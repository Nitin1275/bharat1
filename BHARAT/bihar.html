    <section id="etymology"><h2>Etymology</h2><p>The name Bihar is derived from the Sanskrit word "Vihara," which means "monastery" or "abode." This is because the region was home to many Buddhist monasteries (vihƒÅras) during ancient times. Bihar became a significant center for Buddhist learning, especially with sites like Bodh Gaya, where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment, and Nalanda University, one of the oldest universities in the world.

      Before it was known as Bihar, the region was called Magadha, an ancient kingdom that played a key role in Indian history. The name "Magadha" likely referred to the people of the region. Over time, as Buddhism spread, the term "Vihara" became associated with the region, eventually evolving into the name Bihar.
      
      The name Bihar reflects the state's rich religious and intellectual history, particularly its contributions to Buddhism, education, and culture.
